**All you need to do is click on what is interesting.** This is a special trait of this website - by [[Writing in hypertext]], it is structured for both you and I to explore my thoughts. In a linear piece of writing, all ideas would be sequenced into one narrative. In my hypertext writing, the narrative is emergent and the ideas are associative.

This website is an open notebook. The purpose of this is to share the ideas that I'm exploring and to think in public. This means that, unlike a traditional blog, I'm showcasing many ideas that are in development rather than complete. If you'd like to see more detail or have related thoughts, feel free to leave a comment or tweet at me . If you would like to work with me on a behaviorally informed product strategy, send me a note at []().

### FAQ

[[**First Design**<img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg"/>::lmn]]Why is the website structured the way it is?

{:.boxit}
> The design of the website is inspired by multiple sources with the intention of making the website more functional. Having said that, I am not a skilled front-end developer/UI-developer, so I could only come somewhat closer to my inital design that I sketched *(see left or click on this &#8853; icon beside the question above if you are on a mobile device)*, hopefully this will clear why it's structured the way it is. In fact, I had to remove the lab option because of my current inability to design it. That said, I can also safely say that I am improving based on the initial iterations of the website that can be seen here:
